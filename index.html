    <h1>The Lord of the Hillbillies</h1>



    <p>Come and listen to my story about a man named Clive, a poor mountaineer who barely kept his family alive. And then one day he was shootin at some food, and up through the ground come a bubblin crude. Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea. </p>

    <p>One of the most interesting things about Bilbo is that he had this magic fishstick that turned him invisible. That's super cool. Unfortunately, when he turned invisible he couldn't actually see anything because light passes through him without refracting in his eyes. But still, it was useful for parlor tricks.</p>

    <p>All was well and good until Bilbo's birthday came about and Gandalf, the white wizard, showed up. Being a mutant, he had the power to control magnetic fields, which means he could feel the presence of the fishstick and take it any time he wished.</p>

    <p>Well, the first thing you know ol Clive's a millionaire. The kinfolk said "Jed move away from there." Said "California is the place you ought to be", so they loaded up the truck and they moved to the Shire. After all, Clive had a strong, independent, personality and really detested being told what to do.</p>

Said "Californy is the place you ought to be", so they loaded up the truck and they moved to the Shire. After all, Clive had a strong, independent, personality and really detested being told what to do.</p>

    <p>When he arrived at the Shire, he was immediately confronted with his first problem: the shire-folk don't accept paper money. Clive couldn't even do much with his change, because Hobbits know better than to accept clad coins. So Clive moved in with a very nice fellow by the name of Bilbo Baggins. Living with Bilbo was nice because he had plenty of food and beer. Unfortunately, the house was a little cramped because Hobbits are a bit shorter than humans. But they enjoyed living their nonetheless.</p>
